Hello, my name is Devan, user DevanO00. I am a second year student in the ITPA program at NBCC. 
I am experienced in front end development using JS, React, and Express. 
I am also experienced in back end development using C#, Java, and PHP. 
I am experienced in database scripting languages like SQL, and MongoDB as well.

I am a huge tech geek and my hobbies include programming, gaming, and tcg's. 
I love front end development, and want to become a web developer.

Currently, I am learning back end development in PHP, and front end development in Java. More
